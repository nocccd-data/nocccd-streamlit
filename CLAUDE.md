# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Is

Streamlit dashboards for NOCCCD (North Orange County Community College District) data reporting and analytics — the **NOCCCD Data Hub**. The app runs in two modes:
- **Local**: queries Oracle EDW directly via `oracledb` + SQLAlchemy
- **Cloud** (Streamlit Cloud): downloads pre-extracted `.hyper` files from Tableau Cloud

A pipeline (`src/pipeline/`) handles the ETL: Oracle → Hyper → Tableau Cloud.

## Workflow: notebooks → nocccd-streamlit

New analyses start as Jupyter notebooks in either **nocccd-scff** (SCFF/funding analyses) or **nocccd-sql** (ad-hoc district queries), where SQL queries and visualization logic are prototyped and validated with stakeholders. Once validated, the analysis is ported here as a production Streamlit tab.

**Source repos:**
- **nocccd-scff**: SCFF degree/award/CTE comparisons — notebooks in `nocccd-scff/notebooks/`, SQL in `nocccd-scff/sql/`
- **nocccd-sql**: Ad-hoc queries (e.g. class schedule heatmap) — notebooks in `nocccd-sql/district/notebooks/`, SQL in `nocccd-sql/district/queries/`

**What gets ported:**
- **SQL queries**: source repo SQL → `src/pipeline/sql/` (adapted for pipeline extraction with acyr/term placeholders)
- **SQL parameterization**: `expand_in_clause()` originated in `nocccd-scff/libs/notebook_utils.py` — the same multi-acyr `IN (:t1...)` regex expansion is used in `data_provider.py` and `extract.py`
- **Crosstab tables**: `build_expandable_crosstab()` in notebook_utils was ported to `_build_expandable_crosstab()` in tab modules for expandable HTML pivot tables
- **Funding status categories**: `derive_funding_status()` (Pell/CCPG/Both/Neither) — same logic in both repos
- **Plotly visualizations**: Interactive charts (e.g. `px.imshow()` heatmaps) are ported directly; PDF export uses matplotlib recreations

When starting a new analysis, prototype in a notebook first, then follow the "Adding a new dataset + tab" checklist below.

## Architecture

```
Oracle EDW ──► extract.py ──► .hyper files ──► publish.py ──► Tableau Cloud
                                                                   │
                                              Streamlit Cloud ◄────┘
                                              (downloads .hyper at runtime)
```

### Dual-mode data access (`data_provider.py`)

`_is_cloud()` decides the mode: returns `True` if `FORCE_CLOUD=1` env var is set OR `config.ini` doesn't exist (Streamlit Cloud has no Oracle access). Each public `fetch_*()` function is a thin `@st.cache_data(ttl=600)` wrapper around a `_fetch_*_raw()` helper. The `_raw` helpers are un-decorated and can be called without a Streamlit runtime. Note: the mail pipeline does **not** use these `_raw` helpers — it fetches directly from Tableau Cloud Hyper files via `_fetch_from_hyper()` in `mail_config.py` to avoid Oracle and `st.secrets` dependencies.

### Pipeline flow (`src/pipeline/`)

1. **`config.py`** — defines datasets: name → SQL file + value list + `param_name` + `db_section`. Each dataset stores its values under a semantic key (e.g. `mis_acyr_id`, `acyr_code`, `fisc_year`) and `param_name` tells extract.py which key to read.
2. **`extract.py`** — reads SQL, resolves values via `cfg[param_name]`, expands `IN (:t1...)` or loops single-param SQL, queries Oracle, writes `.hyper` via `pantab.frame_to_hyper()`
3. **`publish.py`** — uploads `.hyper` to "Streamlit Data" project on Tableau Cloud; also has `download_hyper()` which downloads `.tdsx`, extracts `.hyper` from the ZIP
4. **`run.py`** — CLI orchestrator, reads Tableau credentials from `.streamlit/secrets.toml`

### Mass mailing system (`src/pipeline/mail/`)

Generates filtered PDF reports and emails them to recipients via Gmail SMTP (`nocccd.reports@gmail.com`).

1. **`mail_config.py`** — `REPORT_REGISTRY` maps report types to fetch/filter/PDF functions. `CAMPAIGNS` defines mail jobs with parameters, subject/body templates, and recipient lists with per-recipient filter overrides. Data is fetched from **Tableau Cloud Hyper files** (same source as Streamlit Cloud), not Oracle — this avoids Oracle dependencies and uses pre-extracted data. The `_fetch_from_hyper()` helper loads Tableau credentials directly from `secrets.toml` (no `st.secrets`).
2. **`report_generator.py`** — orchestrator: fetches data **once** from Tableau Cloud, then for each recipient applies filters, generates PDF, sends email. Returns `list[SendResult]` with success/failure per recipient. Accepts a `progress_callback` for UI integration.
3. **`sender.py`** — sends a single email with PDF attachment via Gmail SMTP/TLS (`nocccd.reports@gmail.com`, port 587, app password auth). Rate-limited with `time.sleep(2)` between sends.
4. **`run.py`** — CLI entry point (`python -m src.pipeline.mail`). Supports `--dry-run` and `--recipient` flags.

**Adding a new report type to the mail system:**
1. Add a `generate_report_pdf(df, params) -> bytes` function in the tab module
2. Add a `_fetch_<report>()` function in `mail_config.py` using `_fetch_from_hyper()`
3. Register in `REPORT_REGISTRY` with fetch_fn, filter_columns, pdf_fn
4. Create campaigns in `CAMPAIGNS` dict with recipients and filters

**Email credentials**: Stored in `.streamlit/secrets.toml` under `[email]` section. Uses a dedicated Gmail account (`nocccd.reports@gmail.com`) with App Password (2-Step Verification must be enabled on the Google account). Tableau Cloud credentials in the same file are used to download Hyper data.

**Scheduled delivery**: `.github/workflows/mail-reports.yml` runs at 9am PDT weekdays via GitHub Actions cron. Also supports manual trigger from the Actions tab. Secrets are stored in GitHub repo settings (Settings > Secrets), mapped to `secrets.toml` keys at runtime by the workflow.

### Tab system (`src/scripts/tabs/`)

`tabs/__init__.py` has a `TABS` list of `(label, render_fn)` tuples. `streamlit_app.py` renders whichever tab is selected in the sidebar.

**Adding a new dataset + tab (full checklist):**
1. Add SQL file to `src/pipeline/sql/`
2. Register dataset in `src/pipeline/config.py` (name, sql_file, param_name, values under semantic key, db_section)
3. Add a `fetch_*()` function in `data_provider.py` — use `_query_oracle()` for multi-acyr SQL or `_query_oracle_single_acyr()` for single-acyr SQL. Pass `db_section=` matching the config entry.
4. Create tab module in `src/scripts/tabs/` with a `render()` function
5. **Default values**: Import from `config.py` (`from src.pipeline.config import DATASETS`) — never hardcode value lists in tab files. Look up via the dataset's `param_name`. Example: `cfg = DATASETS["your_dataset"]; _DEFAULT_VALS = cfg[cfg["param_name"]]`
6. **Widget keys**: Use a unique prefix for all `st.session_state` keys and widget `key=` params to avoid collisions between tabs
7. Register in `tabs/__init__.py`
8. Add a project card in `home_config.py` — `tab_label` must exactly match the label string in `tabs.TABS` or the Home "Open" button won't navigate correctly
9. Update `README.md` file tree

### Cascading sidebar filters

The Seat Count Report tab (`seat_count_report.py`) uses cascading dynamic filters: Term Code → Campus → Division → Department. The approach:
1. Query button fetches **all** rows for the selected term into `st.session_state`
2. Campus/Division/Department `st.sidebar.selectbox()` widgets each include an "All" option
3. Each filter's options list is derived from the **already-filtered** DataFrame (filtered by parent selections)
4. When a parent filter changes, Streamlit reruns the script; child options update and reset to "All" if the previous selection is no longer valid
5. No additional database calls — all filtering is local pandas operations

This pattern is suitable for any tab where the full dataset fits in memory and users need hierarchical drill-down.

### Persistence projections (`persistence_by_styp.py`)

The Persistence by Student Type tab supports forecasting the next academic year's persistence rates. Two methods are available via a sidebar toggle:

- **Linear Regression**: `np.polyfit(x, y, 1)` — extrapolates a least-squares trend line. Reports R² (goodness of fit) per group. Minimum 2 data points.
- **Weighted Moving Average**: last 3 data points weighted [1×, 2×, 3×]. Minimum 3 data points.

Projected values are clipped to [0, 1]. The next term label is derived from MIS term ID pattern (IDs increment by 10 per year: 207→217→…→257→267).

**Plotly facet subplot gotcha**: `px.line(facet_col_wrap=3)` does NOT store traces in categorical order — the trace order matches Plotly's internal subplot layout, which differs from the category order. To add projection traces to the correct facet panel, match each existing trace to its category by comparing y-data with `np.allclose()`, then read the trace's `xaxis`/`yaxis` to determine its subplot. Setting `xaxis="x"` on `go.Scatter()` raises a validator error in some Plotly versions — only set `xaxis`/`yaxis` for non-default subplots (i.e., skip when value is `"x"` or `"y"`).

**PDF export**: Includes projected dashed lines on all charts plus a final methodology page (method description, caveat, R² table for linear regression) when projections are active.

Widget prefix: `"pbs_"`

### Admin authentication (`auth.py`, `admin_config.py`)

Protected tabs (currently Mail Admin) require a password before access. The system:

1. **`admin_config.py`** — `PROTECTED_TABS` set defines which tab labels require authentication
2. **`auth.py`** — `render_admin_hub()` shows the admin tab selector after password check. Password stored in `.streamlit/secrets.toml` under `[admin]` section: `password = "your-password"`
3. **`streamlit_app.py`** — splits `TABS` into public and admin lists. Admin button appears in the sidebar below the author line. `on_change` callback on the project dropdown exits admin mode automatically.

Session state keys: `_admin_mode`, `_admin_authenticated`, `_admin_selected_tab`

**Adding a new admin-protected tab**: Add the tab label string to `PROTECTED_TABS` in `admin_config.py`.

### Class Schedule Heatmap drill-down

The heatmap tab (`class_schedule_heatmap.py`) shows section counts by day/time. Below each heatmap, an expander with dropdown selectors (Campus+Day or Day+Hour depending on chart type) lets users drill into a specific cell combination. `_render_drilldown()` shows 4 tables: top 10 Divisions, top 10 Departments, top 10 Subjects, and full Modality breakdown — each with enrollment count and percentage. CRN deduplication (`drop_duplicates(subset=["crn"])`) is applied before aggregation to avoid inflated counts from multiple meeting rows per section.

Widget prefix: `"csh_"`

### BOT (Board of Trustees) tabs (`bot_goal*_*.py`)

BOT tabs recreate charts from the annual Board of Trustees Excel report. Each Excel tab becomes one Streamlit tab. The SQL returns enrollment-level records (one row per pidm+crn) with demographic columns; all charts aggregate from this raw data.

**Standard chart set per tab** (4 charts, reuse this pattern for each new BOT goal tab):
1. **Headcount by Campus** — grouped bar chart (`px.bar`, `barmode="group"`) with NOCCCD unduplicated total + 5-yr % change horizontal bar chart. Layout: `st.columns([3, 1])`.
2. **Proportion by Race/Ethnicity** — HTML data-bar table (inline `<div>` bars proportional to percentage, colored per race) + summary HTML table with counts and 5-yr % change. Layout: `st.columns([3, 2])`.
3. **Proportion by Gender** — horizontal grouped bar chart (`px.bar`, `orientation="h"`, academic year on y-axis) + summary HTML table. Layout: `st.columns([3, 2])`.
4. **First-Generation Status** — line chart (`px.line`, markers + text labels) for **Credit colleges only** (excludes NOCE) + summary HTML table. Layout: `st.columns([3, 2])`.

**Key patterns:**
- Raw DataFrame stored in `st.session_state["bg1_df"]` — all 4 charts aggregate from it, no re-querying
- NOCCCD unduplicated count: `df.groupby("academic_year")["pidm"].nunique()` (cross-campus dedup, NOT sum of per-campus counts)
- Credit-only filter for first-gen: `df[df["site"] == "Credit"]` (NOCE excluded due to survey data gaps)
- Deduplication: `df.drop_duplicates(subset=["pidm", "academic_year"])` before counting
- 5-yr % change: `(last_year - first_year) / first_year * 100`
- Each chart section has: title block (subheader + markdown + caption), chart+table columns, "Source: Banner" footer
- Summary HTML tables use race/gender/first-gen colored backgrounds on all cells

**Rate metrics (Goal 2+ tabs)**: Charts 2-4 (race, gender, first-gen) compute proportions relative to a **base population** dataset, not within the tab's own dataset. For example, "Hispanic certificate rate" = Hispanic cert earners / total Hispanic students. This is implemented via `base_df` parameter:
- Each Goal 2+ tab fetches both its own data AND a base population dataset
- `render_bot_charts(df, titles, base_df=base)` passes the base population
- Aggregation functions (`aggregate_race`, `aggregate_gender`, `aggregate_firstgen`) use `base_df` for the per-group denominator when provided
- Goal 1 Students tab passes `base_df=None` — proportions are within its own population (composition metric)
- Chart 1 (headcount) always shows absolute counts regardless of `base_df`

**Base population per tab**: Most Goal 2+ tabs use `bot_goal1_students` as the denominator. The only exception is:
- **BOT Goal 2 - Living Wage** (`bot_goal2_wage.py`): uses `bot_goal2_wage_denom` (SQL at `src/pipeline/sql/bot_goal2_wage_denom.sql`) as its base population. This is a specialized denominator that excludes students who enrolled in the next academic year or transferred (since living wage is measured for students who leave the system). The `bot_goal2_wage_denom` dataset has no standalone tab — it's used purely as a denominator via `fetch_bot_goal2_wage_denom()` in `data_provider.py`.

**Campus scope per tab**: Some BOT tabs are scoped to credit colleges only (Cypress + Fullerton, excluding NOCE). The filter is applied at the **SQL level** (e.g., `WHERE a.site = 'Credit'` in the SQL), not in Python. Credit-only tabs currently include:
- Goal 2: Certificates, Associate Degrees, ADT, Bachelor's, Transfers, Financial Aid

Noncredit-only (NOCE) tabs: Goal 2 Noncredit Certificates. All-campus tabs (credit + noncredit): Goal 1 Students, Goal 2 Living Wage.

When adding a new tab, align the titles dict (`org`, captions) with the SQL's actual scope. "NOCCCD Credit Colleges" vs "NOCE" vs "NOCCCD" as appropriate.

**Configurable flags in titles dict:**
- `include_nocccd` (default `True`): set `False` for single-campus tabs (e.g., NOCE noncredit) to skip the NOCCCD unduplicated bar. Credit-only tabs keep it since "NOCCCD (Unduplicated)" meaningfully represents Cypress+Fullerton combined.
- `credit_only_firstgen` (default `True`): set `False` for noncredit tabs so first-gen data isn't filtered out. Redundant (but harmless) for tabs already filtered to credit at the SQL level.
- `headcount_only` (default `False`): set `True` to skip charts 2-4 (race, gender, first-gen). Used by Bachelor's tab where the population is too small for meaningful demographic breakdowns.

**Plotly horizontal grouped bar gotcha**: Bars render in reverse legend order. To get the desired top-to-bottom order, pass `category_orders` with the reversed label list.

Widget prefix: `"bg1_"` (Goal 1), use `"bg2_"`, `"bg3_"`, etc. for subsequent goals.

### SQL parameterization

Two patterns are supported:
- **Multi-acyr**: SQL uses `IN (:t1...)`. Both `extract.py` and `data_provider.py` dynamically expand the placeholder list to match the number of acyrs via case-insensitive regex substitution (`re.IGNORECASE`). Use `_query_oracle()` in `data_provider.py`. SQL files may use uppercase `IN` or lowercase `in` — both work.
- **Single-acyr**: SQL uses a single named bind like `:mis_acyr_id`. `extract.py` detects this (no `IN` expansion match) and loops over each acyr, concatenating results. Use `_query_oracle_single_acyr()` in `data_provider.py`.

### Sidebar PDF export

Tabs with PDF export (Fast Facts, Class Schedule Heatmap, Seat Count Report, Persistence by Student Type) use `st.sidebar.download_button()` to offer a PDF download.

**Critical ordering rule**: The PDF download button block **must run after the query block**, not before it. Streamlit executes top-to-bottom; if the PDF check (`if "key" in st.session_state`) runs before the query block that sets that key, the button won't appear on the same run as the query — it only shows after navigating away and back.

```python
# CORRECT — PDF block after query block
query_btn = st.sidebar.button("Query", key="xx_query_btn")

if query_btn:
    # ... fetch data, store in st.session_state["xx_data"] ...

if "xx_data" in st.session_state:
    st.sidebar.download_button("Download PDF", data=..., key="xx_pdf_btn")
```

**PDF rendering approach**: Use matplotlib (not kaleido/plotly `to_image()`). Kaleido 1.x launches a Chrome process to render images, which is slow and causes a visible Chrome window to flash on macOS. Matplotlib renders natively with no browser dependency. Two patterns exist:
- **Table-based**: `ax.table()` renders a DataFrame as a table on a matplotlib axes. Good for small/medium tables. See `fast_facts.py` and `class_schedule_heatmap.py`.
- **Row-by-row drawing**: For long banded reports that span many pages, draw each row with `ax.text()` and `Rectangle` patches directly on a full-page axes (`ax.set_xlim(0, PAGE_W)`). This avoids clipping — rows flow continuously across pages. See `seat_count_report.py` (`_generate_pdf`).

**Page layout**: Use a fixed page size (e.g. `8.5 x 11` portrait for tables, `11 x 8.5` landscape for charts) and position content with `fig.subplots_adjust()` margins. Do **not** use `tight_layout()` or `bbox_inches="tight"` — these shrink-wrap the figure to the content, leaving no room for headers/footers and causing overlaps. Content should fit within the page margins, not fill the entire page.

**Tab title header**: Every exported PDF must include the tab title (e.g. "Fast Facts", "Class Schedule Heatmap") as a `fig.suptitle()` on the first page. This makes it clear which tab the PDF came from when printed or shared.

**Page footer**: Every PDF page must include a footer via `_add_pdf_footer(fig)` called before each `pdf.savefig()`. The footer has the app URL (`https://nocccd.streamlit.app/`) left-justified and the author (`Author: Jihoon Ahn  jahn@nocccd.edu`) right-justified, both in small grey font (`fontsize=7, color="grey"`).

## Theme System

The app supports light/dark mode via Streamlit 1.55's built-in theme toggle. Custom colors are applied in `src/scripts/theme.py` using `apply_theme()`, which injects CSS and a small JS snippet.

### How it works

- **`light-dark()` CSS function**: All custom colors use `light-dark(light-val, dark-val)`. Streamlit sets `color-scheme` on `[data-testid="stApp"]`, and the browser resolves `light-dark()` automatically.
- **`_COLOR_SCHEME_SYNC` JS**: A MutationObserver watches `stApp` for class changes and copies the `color-scheme` value to `<html>`. This is needed because portaled elements (selectbox dropdowns) are rendered outside `stApp` and wouldn't otherwise inherit the scheme.
- **`config.toml`**: Defines light/dark palette (backgrounds, text, sidebar) under `[theme.light]` / `[theme.dark]`. `primaryColor = "#003056"` (NOCCCD navy).
- **Dataframe theming**: Streamlit 1.55 exposes `dataframeBorderColor` and `dataframeHeaderBackgroundColor` in `config.toml`. These feed directly into glide-data-grid's React props — CSS variable overrides or JS monkey-patches will NOT work because the canvas reads from React props, not CSS vars.

### Gotchas (Streamlit 1.55)

- **Portaled dropdowns**: Baseweb selectbox dropdowns are portaled to the document root, outside `stApp`. They don't inherit `color-scheme`, so `light-dark()` won't work without the `_COLOR_SCHEME_SYNC` observer. Dropdown text color needs a separate `stSelectboxVirtualDropdown` rule since it can't be scoped to a sidebar/main ancestor.
- **Selector names**: `stVerticalBlockBorderWrapper` doesn't exist in 1.55. Use `[data-testid="stColumn"] [data-testid="stVerticalBlock"]` for card styling.
- **Progress bar fill**: The fill bar is `[data-testid="stProgress"] [role="progressbar"] > div > div > div` (triple-nested div). Targeting `[role="progressbar"]` itself only styles the container track.
- **Sidebar text color**: Sidebar forces white text via `config.toml`. Selectbox widgets inside the sidebar inherit white, but the dropdown menu is portaled out, so it needs its own color rule.
- **Dataframe canvas**: `st.dataframe()` uses glide-data-grid which renders to a `<canvas>` element. CSS cannot style canvas content. The only way to customize gridline color, header background, and text colors is through `config.toml` theme keys (`dataframeBorderColor`, `dataframeHeaderBackgroundColor`, `textColor`). Header text color and index column text color are derived from `textColor` at 60% and 80% opacity respectively — there is no independent control.
- **Card border scoping**: The `[data-testid="stColumn"] [data-testid="stVerticalBlock"]` selector matches both Home page cards and tab metric columns. Home cards already get borders from `st.container(border=True)`, so adding `border` to this generic selector creates a double border. Use `:has([data-testid="stMetric"])` to scope border/padding/radius to metric columns only. Setting `border-color` alone is insufficient — `border-style` defaults to `none`, so use the full `border: 1px solid ...` shorthand.
- **Expanding crosstab tables**: The MIS SP tabs use `_build_expandable_crosstab()` which renders HTML tables via `st.markdown(unsafe_allow_html=True)`. Header styling uses `var(--secondary-background-color, #555)` but this CSS variable doesn't resolve inside `st.markdown()` HTML, so it falls back to `#555` (dark grey) in both modes. The `theme.py` overrides fix this — `.grid-row.header` and `.sub-table thead th` are globally targeted with `light-dark()` to set proper light/dark backgrounds and text colors. Reuse `_build_expandable_crosstab()` for future tabs that need expandable pivot tables.
- **Banded HTML tables**: The Seat Count Report uses `.sc-banded` CSS class for grouped banded tables rendered via `st.markdown(unsafe_allow_html=True)`. Styled in `theme.py` with `light-dark()` for department headers (`.dept-header`), course headers (`.course-header`), subtotal rows (`.subtotal-row`, `.dept-total`), and fill rate coloring (`.sc-fillrate-high/med/low`). Each division is wrapped in `st.expander()`. Reuse this pattern for future banded/grouped reports.

### Adding themed elements

1. Use `light-dark(light-val, dark-val)` for all color properties
2. Always add `!important` — Streamlit's inline styles have high specificity
3. If colors look wrong, inspect the DOM with Playwright (`browser_snapshot`) to find the actual element and its test-id
4. Portaled elements (dropdowns, dialogs) need rules without ancestor scoping — they live at the document root
5. Add new CSS rules to `THEME_CSS` in `theme.py`; no changes needed to `apply_theme()`

## Configuration

- **Oracle credentials**: `src/pipeline/libs/config.ini` (gitignored; copy from `config.ini.template`)
- **Tableau Cloud PAT**: `.streamlit/secrets.toml` (keys: `SERVER`, `SITE_NAME`, `PAT_NAME`, `PAT_VALUE`)
- **Admin password**: `.streamlit/secrets.toml` under `[admin]` section (key: `password`)
- **Email credentials**: `.streamlit/secrets.toml` under `[email]` section (Gmail SMTP for mass mailing)
- **Python version**: pinned to 3.13 in `.python-version` (pantab wheels unavailable for 3.14)

## Deployment

Deployed to Streamlit Cloud at `nocccd.streamlit.app`. Pushes to `main` trigger automatic redeploy. Tableau secrets are configured in the Streamlit Cloud dashboard. After Oracle data changes, re-run the pipeline (`python -m src.pipeline.run`) to refresh Hyper files on Tableau Cloud.

## Key Constraints

- `pantab` must stay pinned to `==5.2.2` (API differences between major versions)
- `streamlit_app.py` inserts repo root into `sys.path` at startup — required for Streamlit Cloud where only the script's directory is on the path
- SQL files live in `src/pipeline/sql/` (tracked in git); `.hyper` files are gitignored in `src/pipeline/hyper/`
- Oracle Instant Client: `/Users/hoonywise/Oracle/instantclient_23_3` with `lib -> .` symlink (macOS SIP workaround)
